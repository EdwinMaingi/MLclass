Here we have 2 datasets that needed to be cleaned and analysed, then from the dataset we need to create a prediction model.

              **CHURN DATASET**
(Cell 39-40): We begin by mounting the google drive storage where the dataset is stored in and then import all the necessary libraries.
(Cell 41-42): We then had to use the pandas library to read the dataset, and at cell 42 we had display the cotents of the dataset.
(Cell 44): Here we requested to know the actual columns in the dataset. Here we can see that the columns are;'RowNumber', 'CustomerId', 'Surname', 'CreditScore', 'Geography', 'Gender', 'Age', 'Tenure', 'Balance', 'NumOfProducts', 'HasCrCard', 'IsActiveMember', 'EstimatedSalary', 'Exited'
(Cell 46): We then put in to display the maximum number of columns and maximum number of rows.
